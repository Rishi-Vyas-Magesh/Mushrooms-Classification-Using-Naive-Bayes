# Mushrooms-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes
This is a Multi-Class Classification performed using Naive Bayes classification as the underlying ML algorithm

I am also familiar with 'R' Programming and this project was undertaken so. The dataset was take from Kaggle after extensive search and it was the right place to showcase my Python understanding and Work on first converting the dataset into a more suitable version for the Algorithm to work as seen in "mushroom_modified" file and You can also further see my implementation of "Naive Bayes" after sufficient understanding, pre processing and analysis of data.

Also, in the end of the script, the evaluation metrics are clearly displayed(Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision etc) and it is a good result.

Thank You
